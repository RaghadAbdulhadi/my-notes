### A fresh graduate **civil engineer** who previously worked as a **content creator** and a **teacher assistant** at *Abwaab* an online learning platform, aside with studying html, css, and javascript through online courses. Currently I'm studying software development at *Luminus Technical University Collage* and I fully believe that I will be able to take the path I have passion in, reach out and work as a **software developer** by learning Python, Java Script and Full Stack. The systematic learning process that LTUC provides will assist me to learn different coding languages effectively, by practicing and working on my own projects. Of course being guided by experts and specialists will make a big difference. The course will certainly develop my ability to:
- work under pressure.
- work within a team effectively.
- improve my problem solving skills.
